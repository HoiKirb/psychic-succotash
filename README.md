# Chaotic Neutral !

A mod that adds... **Plushies**... and... a **Flintlock Pistol**... And ok this
mod is mainly created for my friends rather than anything serious

## *but hey ! does no matter*
What I want this mod to be is some kind of base for other mods to base around,
with a code that is clear enough so that those who just get into modding have
everything right there ! From :
- How to make an Item, and make it interactible
- Making an Item that shoots projectiles
- Making a block...
- Armor Piece...
- Cetera Metera...
- ...
- 
- 
- Making a thermonuclear bomb in Minecraft.

Well hope you have a good day, still working on it and see ya **:D**
